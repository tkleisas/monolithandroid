Robotic Space Rock 1.0.13 is on the downloads list. I encourage you to download it and try it out on a real hardware device, like the T-Mobile G1 or the HTC Magic. You can provide your feedback through the Issues tab, or you can post a comment on my blog, http://tkcodesharing.blogspot.com
This version is updated for the 1.5 version of the android platform, also known as "cupcake".If you want to use the previous version of android (1.1) use the 1.0.8 beta version. If you find any bugs, please post them here, in the Issues tab or in my blog.

The name of the game was changed from "MonolithAndroid" to "Robotic Space Rock" (机器人空间摇滚) in order to comply to Google's Android Brand Permissions found at http://www.android.com/branding.html
So, since a program cannot have the term android in it's name in order to be published to the Android Market, I changed the name of the game to Robotic Space Rock which has a b - movie, "All your base are belong to us" feel.
