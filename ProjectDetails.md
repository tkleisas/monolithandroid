# Development Environment #
The code is currently developed using Eclipse with the ADT plugin. The current Android SDK used is 1.5. The development machine is an AMD Phenom 9750 @2.4GHz with 8Gig of RAM that I put together lately and a Macbook @2.4GHz 4Gig of Ram, running Windows Vista Ultimate Edition and MacOSX respectively.

# Problems #

  * Emulator speed. The emulator speed (Especially when using OpenGL/ES) is slow.


# Planned Features #
To be available

# Other Tools #

The game is being developed using Open Source Tools. Graphics and bitmaps are created using the GIMP paint program. Music is created using Audacity, Apple Garageband and OpenMPT tracker. Demo videos are created using CamStudio.

# Media #

The game uses images from Wikipedia. The soundtrack is songs I created using various programs. Usually the song changes every a few releases
