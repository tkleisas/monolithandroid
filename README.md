# monolithandroid AKA Robotic Space Rock

Originally hosted on google code, one of the first Android open source projects, started back in 2007, almost a year before the first android phone the T-mobile G1 came out. After a name change (because of Google naming rules) a takedown from the android market from Tetris company and a lot of Android versions in between, it has hopefully found a permanent home in Github for the software archaeologist to peruse and analyse.
