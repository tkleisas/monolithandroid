# monolithandroid AKA Robotic Space Rock

Originally hosted on google code, one of the first Android open source projects, started back in 2007, almost a year before the first android phone the T-mobile G1 came out. After a name change (because of Google naming rules) a takedown from the android market from Tetris company and a lot of Android versions in between, it has hopefully found a permanent home in Github for the software archaeologist to peruse and analyse.

The name of the game was changed from "MonolithAndroid?" to "Robotic Space Rock" (机器人空间摇滚) in order to comply to Google's Android Brand Permissions found at http://www.android.com/branding.html So, since a program cannot have the term android in it's name in order to be published to the Android Market, I changed the name of the game to Robotic Space Rock which has a b - movie, "All your base are belong to us" feel.

Robotic Space Rock formerly known as MonolithAndroid? is a 3D game for the android mobile phone platform. The intent is to create a fun to play game, and familiarize with the rich API of the android platform. The game uses openGL ES to render the graphics. As well as the classic gameplay, the game provides an additional game mode, "Monolith" with gameplay rules from Conway's game of life.
